# Chronic-Disease-Prediction---Classification
Basic Machine Learning Classification project for Chronic disease prediction
Models like GaussianNB, KNeighborsClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, SVM are used used for prediction 
and models accuracy is calculated by confusion_matrix, accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score
